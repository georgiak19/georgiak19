# 👋 Hi there, I'm Georgia

I'm a backend engineer who enjoys working with Java and building systems that move, process, and search data — especially in cloud or distributed environments.

Lately, I’ve been exploring cloud services (mostly Azure) and learning how different tools like storage, search, and monitoring can be wired together to build real-world systems. Creative by nature, my long-term goal is to grow into system architecture and help shape how large systems are designed and migrated to the cloud.

🔧 I’ve been experimenting with:
- A cloud-native text editor backend (Java Spring Boot) using CosmosDB / DynamoDB
- A simple Flask UI supporting login with Entra ID
- Azure Functions + Event Grid integration
- A Spring Boot app wiring multiple Azure services, including custom Micrometer metrics to Azure Monitor

🧪 These projects were used as part of my prep for [**AZ-204**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/georgiakonstantinou-3043/credentials/4866145855f2499b) and [**DP-420**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/users/georgiakonstantinou-3043/credentials/f89c46899619460a) Azure certifications (repos are private — mostly hands-on experimentation).

📚 I also built a Bookshelf app originally inspired by GCP training labs:
- Started in Python & Flask, then rebuilt in Java (Spring Boot + Thymeleaf)
- Uses Firestore, Cloud Storage, Translate API, and Gemini
- Features include login with Google, book management, user profile, and AI Q&A assistant

🛠️ Currently working on:
- AI-powered search for the bookshelf
- Prompt tuning and multi-turn interactions
- Exploring cloud-native service design patterns
