# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Georgia

I'm a backend engineer who enjoys working with Java and building systems that move, process, and search data â€” especially in cloud or distributed environments.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring cloud services (mostly Azure), looking into how storage, indexing, and monitoring can be wired together across different providers. Creative by nature, my long-term goal is to grow into system architecture and help shape how large systems are designed and migrated to the cloud.

ðŸ”§ I'm currently building and experimenting with:
- A cloud-native text editor backend using CosmosDB / DynamoDB
- A simple Flask UI with Entra ID login
- Azure Functions + Event Grid integration
- A Spring Boot app wiring multiple Azure services with observability

These projects were part of my hands-on prep for the [**AZ-204**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/georgiakonstantinou-3043/credentials/4866145855f2499b) and [**DP-420**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/users/georgiakonstantinou-3043/credentials/f89c46899619460a) Azure certifications.  
(Repos are private for now, mostly used for learning and experimentation.)
